# iOS-Portfolio
2 years of experience in Mobile App Development using Swift. Currently working with HYPD as Software Engineer (iOS). Deep knowledge of MVVM with Combine and non-reactive. Sound experience of implementing SOLID principles. Also an active contributor on open-source and [stackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/12206321/anubhav-singh).

# [HYPD Creator](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/hypd-creators/id1663190583)
HYPD Creator is an e-commerce application for creators to affiliate a brand/collection of different brands/products and sell through the same platform (SwiftUI, MVVM): Being built using SwiftUI and MVVM, it deals with Creators. Creator onboarding, collection creation to affiliate, sharing collection/brand/product to favourite social media directly through the app, transactions are supported. The project follows a framework-based modular structure With all UI built programmatically.

### My Role ###
Develop the app from **scratch** with the sink of Android and the UI/UX team. I worked with a fast-paced team to deliver features as soon as possible to the 50k users.

#### Created 2 open-source libraries and used them in the HYPD Creator app
- **ShareToSocial** - I created an open-source library to Share images and URL links directly to your favourite social media from your iOS. You can also directly make the status of the same media file.

- **GJourney** - I created another open-source library in SwiftUI to give a brief guide about your iOS to the first-time user.

# [GSatSolarâ€¬](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gsatsolar/id1598082008?platform=iphonee) & [GSatTrack](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gsattrack-mobile/id509350332?platform=iphone)
The GSatSolar app is an easy configuration tool for your GSatSolar Series devices. Update, Deploy, Track, Choose between preset configurations, or get the latest updates from GSE.
GSat Solar is a support application for GSE (SwiftUI, MVVM): Being built using SwiftUI-combine and MVVM, it deals with managing GSat Solar devices. The project follows a framework-based modular structure With all UI builds reactiveSwift. GSat Track is a tracking application for GSE devices(UIkit, MVVM): Being built using UIkit-reactive and MVVM, it deals with tracking the devices of GSE.

### My Role ###
GSat Solar was developed using UIKit with Objective-C and was hard to update with new functionalities so after a decision with senior developers I took the decision to migrate GSatSolar iOS from Objective-C to Swift with the latest SwiftUI framework so we could add functionality without any hassle. Added new functionalities to GSatTrack and resolved bugs.

# [VLC media player](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-media-player/id650377962)
VLC media player is a well-known free and open-source, portable, cross-platform media player software and streaming media server developed by the VideoLAN project.
I was extremely proud when I got selected for Google Summer of Code under VideoLan to work on VLC media player iOS app.

### My Role ###

VLC was in the process of rewriting and updating the entire UI for VLC iOS. There were a lot of components that needed refactoring and needed to get an updated UI. Like for example the video player controller. If we compare it with the VLC Android then the port of VLC Android has done most of that and was successful. I need the same level of vlc-ios to match or surpass the Android app.
